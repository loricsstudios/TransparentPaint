# TransparentPaint

[Telestrator][1] (video marker) designed for OBS. 

TransparentPaint accepts stylus(pen)/touch/mouse drawing on a transparent canvas, snapped to a particular window (e.g. a OBS source projector). 
The drawing output is available for HTTP streaming and can be included by OBS BrowserSource. The output can also be displayed on a chroma-keyed window.

# Installation

Just copy, unzip and run.

.NET Framework 4.6.1 must be installed first.

# Usage

## Test

1. Launch `TransparentPaint`
  * You don't have to allow for firewall access, because we are accessing it locally
2. Open http://127.0.0.1:8010 with Chrome (Only tested on Chrome)
3. Use mouse/stylus/touch to draw something on `TransparentPaint`
4. Some strokes should appear on the chrome.

## Use with OBS

1. Launch `OBS`
2. Stream the strokes to OBS
  1. Create a new BrowserSource
     * Untick local file, URL: http://127.0.0.1:8010
3. To overlay the `TransparentPaint` over the video
  1. Right click on your video source, then select `Windowed Projector`
  2. In the `TransparentPaint`, in the text box near the padlock icon, type `Projector`
  3. Check the padlock, or F6
  4. The `TransparentPaint` should snap to the your source projector.
4. Now you can draw with mouse/stylus/touch

# Known Bugs

* The HTTP streamed output does not include ink currently drawing by stylus/touch.
  
  I have described this in the [Stackoverflow][10], if someone knows the answer please let me know.
  * The ink will appear only after the stylus or finger is up.
  * mouse is fine though.
